# The Mission

A creative outlet for creative people to upload their creations.

## Scope

An applikation where people can upload and share their creativity with eachother and others. They have an account that belongs to just them where they can make, edit and delete posts (picture with title and discription). They can have a profile picture with a description of who they are and what they make. On their profile others can see their posts, they can also sort by catagories or date (or alphabetical).

### Front Page

On the front page, random posts from all users will be seen in no paticular order as the first thing seen. A user can then sort by catagories. A user can then either click on a post that will open that post, here you can like and comment on the post, and go to profiles from there or click on a fan that shows all the accounts on the site.

There will be a sign in button for the users that have account and a sign up button for anyone who wants to have an account.

### Admin Role

If someone with the role of "admin" signs in, they can edit and delete anyones posts to avoid unfit content for the page.

An admin also has en extra fan where they can administrate users of the page. They can edit and delete accounts. They can also change someones role in case more admins are needed or an admin resigns.
